! Getting Started With AHK Command Picker

!! How To Launch AHK Command Picker
To launch AHK Command Picker run the _AHKCommandPicker.ahk_ script.

Once the AHKCommandPicker.ahk script is running, press the Caps Lock key to bring up the AHK Command Picker GUI.  From there just type the name of the command that you want to run, and hit enter to run it.

If you want to turn Caps Lock on, use Shift + Caps Lock to toggle it on and off.


!! Adding New Commands
The commands to include in AHK Command Picker are defined in the "CommandScriptsToInclude.ahk" file. You can either create a new file and add it's path to this one, or simply open "Commands\General.ahk" for editing since it's path is already defined in "CommandScriptsToInclude.ahk". The best practice is to create new files to house your commands, but if you just want to get up and running quickly you may add commands to General.ahk.

There are 2 different (but similar) functions that may be used to add a command to the AHK Command Picker, _AddCommand()_ and _AddNamedCommand()_.  Both of these functions have optional parameters.  Here are the function prototypes, and descriptions of each of the parameters:
{{
AddCommand(functionName, descriptionOfWhatFunctionDoes = "", parameterList = "", defaultParameterValue = "")

AddNamedCommand(commandName, functionName, descriptionOfWhatFunctionDoes = "", parameterList = "", defaultParameterValue = "")
}}+commandName+ = The name of the command to appear in the Command Picker.
+functionName+ = The function to call when this command is selected to run. Unless the AddNamedCommand() function is used, this will also be the name of the command that appears in the Command Picker.
+descriptionOfWhatFunctionDoes+ = A user-friendly message that will appear in the Command Picker telling what the command does.
+parameterList+ = A pre-set list of parameters to choose from in the Command Picker when this command is selected.  Parameter values should be separated by a comma, and if you would like your parameter to show a different name in the GUI, separate the name from the value with a pipe character (|) (e.g. "Name1|Value1, Value2, Name3|Value3").
+defaultParameterValue+ = The parameter value that will be passed to the function when no other parameter is given.

For example, to create a command to explore the C drive, you could use:
{{
AddCommand("ExploreCDrive", "Explore C:\")
ExploreCDrive()
{
    Run, explore C:\
}
}}Here you can see that the command specifies that the "ExploreCDrive" function should be called when this command runs, and that the command's user-friendly description is "Explore C:\".  Next it actually defines the "ExploreCDrive" function and what it should do.

If we wanted to leave the function name as "ExploreCDrive", but have it show up in the Command Picker as "Open C", we would use the AddNamedCommand() function as follows:
{{
AddNamedCommand("Open C", "ExploreCDrive", "Explore C:\")
ExploreCDrive()
{
    Run, explore C:\
}
}}

!! How To Convert An Existing Hotkey Into a Command
Typically most of your existing AHK scripts are bound to a hotkey so that you can quickly launch them using a keyboard shortcut.  For example, you might have the following hotkey to open up C:\SomeFolder whenever the Windows Key + Z is pressed:
{{
#z::
	Run, explore C:\SomeFolder
return
}}To convert this into a command that will show up in the AHK Command Picker, you would change the code to something like:
{{
AddCommand("OpenSomeFolder", "Opens C:\SomeFolder in Windows Explorer")
OpenSomeFolder()
{
	Run, explore C:\SomeFolder
}
}}If you still wanted to have the hotkey, you could leave it as-is, but it would be better practice to have it call the new function to avoid duplicate code.  So you could change it to:
{{
#z::
	OpenSomeFolder()
return
}}Typically your AHK scripts/hotkeys are probably more than one line long, but this shows the general concept.
